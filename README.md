**Daarul Qirat Landing Page**

Daarul Qirat was created to promote the learning of Quranic Arabic and Tajweed for non-Arabic speakers, fostering a deeper connection with the Quran. As part of my passion for building impactful solutions, this landing page aims to attract students in Lagos, Nigeria, and globally to an online institution offering accessible, high-quality Islamic education.
